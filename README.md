# Dynamic-Programming
1. **_Know and understand that dynamic programming is an algorithmic meta-technique for solv-
ing problems._**
2. _From our textbook, what are the four steps used to develop an dynamic-programming algo-
rithm?_
    - 1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.
    - 2. Recursively define the value of an optimal solution.
    - 3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion
    - 4. Construct an optimal solution from computed  information

3. Know and understand the Fibonacci sequence problem. Complexity?
